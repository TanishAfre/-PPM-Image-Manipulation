# CPP project on Image manipulation

This application allows a user to load a Portable Pixmap Format ( .ppm ) image file and apply a range of manipulations to the image. A feature to save the manipulated image should also be incorporated.
In your application implement the following features:
-	Load ppm file: - this should allow a ppm file to be loaded into the application, you may assume that the “File Type Identifier” will be “P6” and each channel is 1 byte in size. If the file does not match this the load function should return false and display an informative message
-	Save ppm file: - After an image has been modified an option should be available to save the image as a ppm file using the format described above
-	Filter Red: - Should show only the red channel of the image
-	Filter Green: - Should show only the green channel of the image
-	Filter Blue: - Should show only the blue channel of the image
-	Greyscale: - Should change the image to greyscale
-	Flip Horizontal: - Should flip the image along the centre Y-axis
-	Flip Vertical: - Should flip the image along the centre X-axis
-	Gamma – conversion from float to int for colour channels
